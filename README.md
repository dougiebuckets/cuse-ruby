<h1>Cuse Ruby</h1>
<p>
Cuse Ruby is a gem built for die-hard Syracuse fans who enjoy building Ruby applications (that is to say, this was an excuse for a die-hard Syracuse fan to build his first Ruby gem :). Learn more here: <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/cuse">https://rubygems.org/gems/cuse</a>
<p>
<h3>How it works:</h3> Upon installing this gem, all output from 'puts' will be appended with "Let's Go Orange!". E.g.,
<p>
<pre><code>>> puts "Georgetown sucks!!"
Georgetown sucks!! Let's Go Orange!
</code></pre>
<p>
<h3>Installation:</h3>
For Ruby on Rails, in your Gemfile simply add the following and perform a 'bundle install':
<pre><code>gem 'cuse'</pre></code>
<p>
For other Ruby applications:
<pre><code>require 'cuse'</code></pre>

Enjoy fellow Cuse nerds!
